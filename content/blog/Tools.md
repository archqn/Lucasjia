Sync is king. It's incredibly convenient for me to have the same content accessible through phone, tablet, laptop and PC. Besides this preference, the general consensus is that simple and effective > over-optimizing. 

1. **OneNote:** Handles lecture notes, studying, and papers where I need to annotate.
2. **Tweek:** Minimal to-do. 
3. **Google Calendar:** Nice to have schedule as well as task list.
4. **Obsidian:** Quick phone notes and shopping lists can be organized on the same platform as more developed writing.
5. Other: **Zotero** for papers, **Workona** for tab manager, **Hevy** for workouts, and **Sheets** for miscellaneous like expenses.
